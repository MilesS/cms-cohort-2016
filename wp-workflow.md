#Wordpress Workflow

Here are some suggested tools to increase workflow.

This will hopefully make things faster for yourself and make redundant stuff less painful. However, it is encouraged to find your own workflow! We are not all the same, so tools that might work for me might be useless to you! :-)

Generally BR gives balsamiq wireframes so you can get started on template layout.

##Daily Workflow

* Scrum meetings in the morning
* Heads down in the afternoon
* Follow up meetings

When an issue or request happens

* Miguel comes to us with check list
* Create issues in github for developer, and close them.

Talking to the client on Basecamp

* For clarity it is okay for cohort to ask.
* If it is for a new product or feature that isn't in basecamp, then it goes to Miguel.
* DO NOT ALLOW SUGGESTIONS!
